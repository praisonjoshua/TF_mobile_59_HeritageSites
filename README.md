# TensorFlow Android Camera Demo


### Android Studio

Android Studio may be used to build the demo in conjunction with Bazel. First,
make sure that you can build with Bazel following the above directions. Then,
look at [build.gradle](build.gradle) and make sure that the path to Bazel
matches that of your system.

At this point you can add the tensorflow/examples/android directory as a new
Android Studio project. Click through installing all the Gradle extensions it
requests, and you should be able to have Android Studio build the demo like any
other application (it will call out to Bazel to build the native code with the
NDK).

### CMake

Full CMake support for the demo is coming soon, but for now it is possible to
build the TensorFlow Android Inference library using
[tensorflow/contrib/android/cmake](../../../tensorflow/contrib/android/cmake).
